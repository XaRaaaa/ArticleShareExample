## Packages
date-fns | Formatting dates for articles and comments
framer-motion | Smooth animations for cards and transitions

## Notes
- Authentication uses cookie-based sessions (credentials: "include")
- Login requires username/password (schema), but UI should support Email login conceptual flow if needed (backend maps email -> user)
- Admin features require checking `user.isAdmin`
