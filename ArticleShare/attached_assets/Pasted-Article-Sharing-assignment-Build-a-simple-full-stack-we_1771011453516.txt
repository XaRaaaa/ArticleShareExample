Article Sharing assignment 
Build a simple full-stack web application where users can register, log in, write short text articles, 
and comment on each other’s articles. The focus is on basic functionality, security practices, 
and clean code, not styling. An admin account should also exist to moderate content. 
Pages / Features Required 
Registration Page 
This page allows new users to sign up and create an account in the system. It collects basic 
details and ensures credentials are stored. 
● Fields: username, email, password 
● On success, redirect to the login page 
Login Page 
This page handles authentication and routes users based on their role (normal user or admin). 
● Login with email + password 
● Normal users → Homepage 
● Admin → Homepage 
Homepage 
The homepage is the central hub of the application, displaying all articles along with their 
comments directly underneath. 
Functionality: 
● Show all articles, sorted by newest first. 
● Each article displays its title, body, author, and timestamp. 
● All comments for each article appear directly below the article. 
● Logged-in users can add comments beneath any article (comment has to have text - 
timestamp). 
● Admin users can delete articles or comments directly from the homepage.  
● Users can delete their own articles or comments only. 
New Article Page 
This page is where users create and publish their own articles. It links each new article to the 
current logged-in user. 
● Logged-in users can create a new article 
● Fields: title and body 
● Save article with author ID 
● Redirect back to login page 
Logout 
This functionality ensures sessions are properly closed and prevents unauthorized access after 
a user signs out. 
● Clears user session 
● Redirects to homepage 
Database 
The database stores user credentials, articles, and comments, linking them together with 
relationships. 
Deliverables 
At the end of the assignment, students should provide a working full-stack application along with 
documentation. 
● Working full-stack app (backend + frontend) 
● read.me  with clear setup instructions (how to install and run locally) 
● No advanced styling required (simple forms and pages are enough) 
● Admin account must be included in the database.
